# Wumpus-World
This is an AI intro class project -- the implemention of a Knowledge-based Wumpus World AI agent using Java.
## Introduction
> The Wumpus World is a cave consisting of rooms connected by passageways.
   Lurking somewhere in the cave is the terrible Wumpus, a beast that eats
   anyone who enters its room. The Wumpus can be shot by an agent, but the
   agent has only one arrow. Some rooms contain bottomless pits that will
   trap anyone who wanders into these rooms (except for the Wumpus, which
   is too big to fall in). The only mitigating feature of this bleak
   environment is the possibility of finding a heap of gold.
